## Dashboards

### Ben

(Sorry, I forgot I was supposed to be taking notes during this and missed a few points)

- Change summation totals
- Titles and headings
- Maybe one bar chart instead of two

### Eric

- Change names of levels
  - Provinces -> Provinces ad territories
  - Urban/rural by county -> Urban/Rural (Canada)
- Rewrangle urban/rural Canada so region is useable
- Comparison graph subsettable to specific industries
- Line separating sides
- Level 1, Level 2 to industry sector (2 digit NAICS), industry subsector (3 digit NAICS)
- Time series to bar chart

## API

- Study about 10 APIs. Focus first on the "big boys" (Google, Facebook, etc)
- Look into cost, methods of accessing, wrappers, etc



## Others

- Get code in shape to be shared
- Look at google API
- Send word doc report
