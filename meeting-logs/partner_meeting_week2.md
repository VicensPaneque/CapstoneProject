### Overview of our analysis

- Exceeded expectation. However depth is missing in our analysis (breath is good).

### Narratives worth pursuing

- **CAUTION:** By data collection methodology, the information for the last period are not accurate (not complete).
- **CAUTION:** Use total subsidy and average supported and rehired employees for our analysis. Business counts is secondary.
- **Rural and urban analysis is of the most interest.**
- **StatCan big-push is to stay at a rural level.**
- **Get employment data to do analysis.**
- Might be worth pursuing to give a profile of each province by CMA/CA/CDS.
- Food sector might be of interest.

### Dashboard

- They want something at a province level and then CSD/CA/CMA.
- Dropdown menus are encouraged.
- Overall make the dashboad more readable.
- Use different projection for the map.
	- Check StatCan boundary file (cartographic). 

### Deliverables

1.	Draft of the paper and dashboard.
